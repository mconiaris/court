			<h2>What is dance/movement therapy?</h2>
			<p>The American Dance Therapy Association (ADTA) defines dance/movement therapy as the psychotherapeutic use of movement to promote emotional, social, cognitive and physical integration of the individual.</p>			
			<h2>How can a dance/movement therapist conduct sessions over a computer?</h2>
			<p>As a trained dance/movement therapist, I currently work as a talk psychotherapist with an understanding and appreciation of how the physical body communicates. Sessions do not necessarily need to include movement, however listening to the messages that our bodies send us can greatly improve the effectiveness of the work.</p>
			<h2>Why don’t you take insurance?</h2>
			<p>Very few insurance companies accept creative arts therapist on their panel of providers, despite great amounts of research demonstrating the evidenced based effectiveness of the treatment. If we decide to work together, we will agree on a sliding fee that works for your budget. If you do have health insurance I can submit the claims to your company, however this is not a dependable form of payment. </p>
